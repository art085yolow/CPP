Move entire project to Linux

Ideas:
	- one project one file
	- one main list(map) of notes
	- tracking deleted/unused ID's below the last ID in the list(example: list size is 50 ID's and tracked unused ID's are 40,42,49).
	- deleted ID's at first are search through the notes list PARENT_ID and CONNECTION to remove ID and deleting at end.
	- saving notes/Memo as text(like json). That means to create function to read and write file in that way.
	- Running app is checking if NOTES and HISTORY folders exist. If not Create them.
	- use Xlib(X11, learn something now) for windows screen
	- 

TODO:

	- make data tree.
	- sorting tree.
	- loading, saving file.
	- rebuild 'Memo' notes
	
	Note{
		ID:
		TITLE:
		[scontainer:]
		[/scontainer]
		DESCRIPT:

		TAGS:
